// A page that allows the user to enter osteology and/or burial information to predict (based on your trained model) the sex of the burial (see information re: IS 455 requirements)
// One option you may consider in your analysis is to use something like this example to build a ML Model that utilizes an .onnx file in ASP.NET:  https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-sci-kit-learn-models-in-net-core-applications-90e24e572f64  OR USE THOMASâ€™ THING: https://is455winter2023.slack.com/archives/C04J19NPYQ5/p1680828615793299
// (Note that this example uses the ASP.NET API template, but could be easily adapted to instead pull the input information from a form to pass to the HTTP Post method on the controller.)
